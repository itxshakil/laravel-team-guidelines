## 📘 Purpose

This repository serves as a **central handbook** for how we build, review, and maintain Laravel applications — together.
It’s not meant to be cloned or executed, but **read, discussed, and improved**.

### You’ll find:

* ✅ **Coding Standards** – clean, consistent PHP & Laravel code
* 🏗️ **Architecture Principles** – scalable and maintainable structures
* 🔒 **Security Guidelines** – protecting code and data at every layer
* 🚀 **Deployment Rules** – environment sanity and production safety
* 🔁 **Team Workflow** – pull requests, reviews, and communication

---

## 🧩 Philosophy

> *“Great teams don’t just write code — they craft consistency.”*

* **Clarity over cleverness** → Readable > Magical
* **Laravel-first mindset** → Follow conventions before inventing new ones
* **Shared accountability** → Every commit matters
* **Continuous evolution** → Update as we learn
